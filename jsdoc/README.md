# ngeo

ngeo is a JS library that aims to ease the development of applications based on
[AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) and [OpenLayers 3](http://openlayers.org).

More specifically, ngeo is a collection of AngularJS Directives and Services
useful for developing applications combining AngularJS and OpenLayers 3.

Through the Directives, Services and examples it provides, ngeo defines
a specific way to combine Angular and OpenLayers 3 in an application.

If you use ngeo we recommend that you also use Closure, because this is the way
we design and use ngeo at Camptocamp. But using Closure is not mandatory:
standalone builds of ngeo can be created.
