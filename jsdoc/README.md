# ngeo

ngeo is a JS library that aims to ease the development of applications based on
[AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) and [OpenLayers](http://openlayers.org).

More specifically, ngeo is a collection of AngularJS Directives and Services
useful for developing applications combining AngularJS and OpenLayers.

Through the Directives, Services and examples it provides, ngeo defines
a specific way to combine Angular and OpenLayers in an application.

If you use ngeo we recommend that you also use Closure, because this is the way
we design and use ngeo at Camptocamp. But using Closure is not mandatory:
standalone builds of ngeo can be created.
